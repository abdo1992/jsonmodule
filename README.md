# JSON+LD Module

This module will eventually replace the rich snippets using microdata that are in all thirty bees themes.

Although the module is stable and should work correctly, this module is being considered a beta release. The reason being is that most themes already have microdata rich snippets. Added the same snippets twice might provide undesired results.
